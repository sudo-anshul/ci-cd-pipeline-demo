## Introduction

The DevOpsFlow project is created to showcase the power of CI/CD pipelines in automating the deployment process for web applications. The project provides a simple web application and a pre-configured CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Features

- Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- Web Application Deployment
- Sample HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Code
- Easy-to-understand Project Structure

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript
- Docker (for containerization)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)
- Other relevant dependencies (list them here)

## Getting Started

To run this CI/CD Pipeline Demo on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CI-CD-Pipeline-Demo.git
   cd CI-CD-Pipeline-Demo

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing changes to the main branch. The pipeline will automatically build and deploy the web application to a server or a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

(Include any additional usage instructions here, such as how to access the deployed application or how to view CI/CD logs.)
